## Task Description

1. **Follow Best Practices**: 
   - Use **Terraform modules** for each component (EC2, ELB, and Auto Scaling).
   - Store **state remotely** with S3 and lock the state using DynamoDB.
   - Commit regularly using **version control**.

2. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Deploy **EC2 instances** to host a web application.
   - Set up an **Elastic Load Balancer** (ELB) to balance traffic across your instances.
   - Configure an **Auto Scaling Group** (ASG) with policies to dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on traffic.

### Bonus Challenge:
- Set up **CloudWatch monitoring** to track performance and trigger scaling actions for your Auto Scaling group.
