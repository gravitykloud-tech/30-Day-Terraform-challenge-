# Day 25: Deploy a Static Website on AWS S3 with Terraform

## Overview

Welcome to Day 25 of the 30-Day Terraform Challenge! ðŸŽ‰ Today, weâ€™re focusing on a **beginner-level** project where you will deploy a simple static website using **AWS S3** and integrate it with a **CloudFront** distribution for content delivery. This project will give you practical experience with **Terraform best practices**, such as using modules, managing state remotely, and properly structuring your project.

The goal is to follow Terraform's best practices while setting up your infrastructure, including:
- Using **Terraform modules** for reusable code.
- Managing **remote state** using S3 and DynamoDB (for state locking).
- Applying **version control** to keep track of changes.
- Applying  **DRY** concepts 

By the end of this project, you'll have deployed a static website accessible via **CloudFront** over a secure HTTPS connection!

## Project Structure
Your project structure should follow this format:

```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ s3-static-website/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ outputs.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ envs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dev/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ terraform.tfvars
â”œâ”€â”€ backend.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ provider.tf
â””â”€â”€ variables.tf

```


## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Terraform Best Practices**
- **Use modules**: Create a reusable module for the S3 bucket that can be easily adapted for other projects.
- **Manage remote state**: Store your state file in an S3 bucket and use DynamoDB for state locking.
- **Version control**: Ensure you commit your changes regularly using Git.

### 2. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - **S3 Bucket**: 
     - Create an S3 bucket to store your website files.
     - Enable public access for the bucket to make the website accessible.
   - **CloudFront Distribution**:
     - Set up a CloudFront distribution to serve the website over HTTPS.
     - Configure the distribution to point to the S3 bucket as the origin.

### 3. **Bonus Challenge**
   - **Route53 Integration**:
     - Optionally, set up a Route53 hosted zone to point your custom domain to the CloudFront distribution.

## Key Concepts
- **S3 for static website hosting**: Learn how to configure S3 for serving static content.
- **CloudFront for CDN**: Ensure your website is delivered over a secure, fast network using CloudFront.
- **Remote state management**: Use S3 to store Terraform state and DynamoDB for state locking.
