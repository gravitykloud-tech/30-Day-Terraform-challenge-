# Day 21: Workflow for Deploying Infrastructure Code

## Overview

Welcome to Day 21 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we focus on the **workflow for deploying infrastructure code**. While this workflow shares many similarities with the application code deployment process, there are some key differences when managing and deploying infrastructure (e.g., databases, load balancers, network configurations). 

By the end of today, you should understand how to apply the steps of the infrastructure code deployment workflow, including managing version control, testing, and deploying infrastructure changes.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Continue reading Chapter 10 of "Terraform: Up & Running"
     - Section: "A Workflow for Deploying Infrastructure Code"
   - **Goal**: Understand the 7-step process for deploying infrastructure code:
     1. Use version control.
     2. Run the code locally.
     3. Make code changes.
     4. Submit changes for review.
     5. Run automated tests.
     6. Merge and release.
     7. Deploy.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Watch the following videos from Section 12:
     - "HCP Terraform (Terraform Cloud) - Version Control Integration" (Video 71)
     - "HCP Terraform (Terraform Cloud) - Private Registry" (Video 72)
   - **Goal**: Learn how to manage infrastructure code with version control and how to share Terraform modules using the private registry.

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Deploying Infrastructure Code**:
     - Follow the steps outlined in the reading to simulate a typical workflow for deploying infrastructure code.
     - Use version control for managing infrastructure code and track changes effectively.
     - Explore Terraform Cloud's private registry feature to store and share infrastructure modules.

### 4. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "A Workflow for Deploying Infrastructure Code with Terraform"

### 5. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "ðŸ”§ Deploying infrastructure code with version control and Terraform Cloud's private registry. Ready for production! #30daytfchallenge #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @Chi Che. #IaC #terraform"

## How to Submit Your Work

### 1. **Create the `day21-update-your-github-username.md` File**
   - Include details of your infrastructure code deployment workflow, version control integration, and using the private registry.
   - Save the file in your `day21-deploying-infra-code` branch.

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage and commit your changes with a message like:
     ```bash
     git add day21-update-your-github-username.md
     git commit -m "Completed Day 21 task on deploying infrastructure code with Terraform"
     ```

### 3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin day21-deploying-infra-code
     ```
   - Create a pull request using the provided template and include any additional comments if necessary.
