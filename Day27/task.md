# Day 27: 3-Tier Multi-Region High Availability Infrastructure with AWS and Terraform

## Task Description

### 1. **Best Practices to Follow**
   - Use **Terraform modules** for reusable infrastructure components (VPC, EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling, RDS, and Route53).
   - Store **Terraform state remotely** using S3 and enable state locking with DynamoDB.
   - Regularly commit changes using **version control** to ensure traceability.

### 2. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - **VPC**: Deploy VPCs with public and private subnets in both `us-east-1` and `us-west-2` regions.
   - **Web Tier**: Deploy an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in public subnets to distribute incoming web traffic.
   - **Application Tier**: Deploy EC2 instances in private subnets, with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to handle scaling.
   - **Database Tier**: Deploy a primary RDS instance with cross-region read replicas.
   - **DNS Failover**: Configure Route53 to manage DNS and failover routing between the regions.

### 3. **Bonus Challenge**
   - Implement **S3 Cross-Region Replication** to replicate static assets (such as images, assets) across AWS regions.
   - Implement **CloudWatch Monitoring** for EC2, ELB, and RDS to track performance and system health.
