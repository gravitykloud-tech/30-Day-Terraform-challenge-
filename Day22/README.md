# Day 22: Putting It All Together - Congratulations on Making It This Far! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to Day 22 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge and the **final chapter** of the book! You've made it to the end of "Terraform: Up & Running", and today weâ€™ll focus on **putting together everything youâ€™ve learned**. From deploying both application and infrastructure code to implementing Terraform in real-world environments, todayâ€™s session will help solidify your understanding.

Youâ€™ll see a **side-by-side comparison** of deploying application code and infrastructure code workflows and how to integrate both for a seamless process. Congratulations on getting this far! ðŸš€ But donâ€™t worryâ€”the journey continues with more hands-on projects in the coming days! ðŸ’ª

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Finish reading Chapter 10 of "Terraform: Up & Running"
     - Section: "Putting It All Together"
   - **Goal**: Understand how to manage both **application code** and **infrastructure code** using Terraform and DevOps practices, and how to promote immutable, versioned artifacts across environments.
   - **Summary of Key Topics**:
     - Use version control for both application and infrastructure code.
     - Run automated tests on a CI server.
     - Deploy with Terraform, ensuring secure workflows using approval checks.
     - Promote immutable, versioned artifacts across environments.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Finish Section 12 with:
     - "HCP Terraform (Terraform Cloud) - Sentinel Policy" (Video 73)
     - "HCP Terraform (Terraform Cloud) - VCS Workflow" (Video 74)
   - **Goal**: Learn how to enforce compliance using **Sentinel policies** and manage workflows using version control with **Terraform Cloud**.

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Integrating Workflows**:
     - Combine the workflows for deploying both application and infrastructure code.
     - Ensure that you are using **version control** for managing both application and infrastructure changes.
     - Implement **Sentinel policies** to enforce security and compliance requirements in your combined workflow.
   - **Reflect on Your Journey**: Share your reflections on what youâ€™ve learned so far! What has been the most interesting part of the journey? ðŸš€

### 4. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "Putting It All Together: Application and Infrastructure Workflows with Terraform"
   - **Bonus Idea**: Reflect on your journey through the challenge and highlight the key skills youâ€™ve gained.

### 5. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "ðŸŽ‰ Finished reading Terraform: Up & Running! Combining application and infrastructure workflows today with Terraform Cloud and Sentinel policies. Next up: more hands-on projects! #30daytfchallenge #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @Chi Che. #IaC #terraform"

## How to Submit Your Work

### 1. **Create the `day22-update-your-github-username.md` File**
   - Include details of your combined application and infrastructure workflows, version control setup, and using Sentinel policies.
   - Reflect on your journey and what youâ€™ve learned!
   - Save the file in your `day22-integrated-workflows` branch.

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage and commit your changes with a message like:
     ```bash
     git add day22-update-your-github-username.md
     git commit -m "Completed Day 22 task on integrating workflows with Terraform"
     ```

### 3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin day22-integrated-workflows
