## Overview

Welcome to Day 19 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, the focus is on **adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in your team**. Moving from managing infrastructure manually to implementing IaC requires not only introducing new tools but also shifting your team's culture and processes. This process can be challenging, especially in larger organizations.
